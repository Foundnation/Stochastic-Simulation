# 1. Monte Carlo Area Estimation of Mandelbrot Set

This repository contains code for assignments related to the Monte Carlo area estimation of the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal in mathematics that is explored using iterative algorithms. In this assignment, Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate the area of the Mandelbrot set.

## Files

### `mandelbrot.py`

Contains core functions for the Monte Carlo area estimation of the Mandelbrot set. This file includes functions essential for iterative calculations, as well as some plotting functions related to the Mandelbrot set.

### `ortho_sampling.py`

Includes code for orthogonal sampling, which is later utilized in `mandelbrot.py`. Orthogonal sampling is a technique used to sample points in a specific pattern that aids in the calculation process for the Mandelbrot set.

### `mandelbrot_notebook.py`

This file contains the results obtained from the execution of the code. It serves as a notebook showcasing the computed results and visualizations to the area estimation of the Mandelbrot set and methods convergence.
